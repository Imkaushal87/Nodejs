📄 Code
console.log("Hello Node js");

var a = 1078698;
var b = 20986;

function multiply(x, y){
    const result = a * b;
    return result;
}

var c = multiply(a, b);

console.log("multiplication result is : ", c);

🔹 What does synchronous mean?

👉 Each statement executes one after another
👉 Next line waits until the previous line finishes

No jumping, no background work, no callbacks here.

🧠 Synchronous Execution Flow (Line by Line)
1️⃣ console.log("Hello Node js");

Printed immediately

Output:

Hello Node js


Execution moves to next line

2️⃣ Variable declarations
var a = 1078698;
var b = 20986;


Memory is allocated

Values assigned

No delay, no async work

3️⃣ Function definition
function multiply(x, y){
    const result = a * b;
    return result;
}


Function is defined, not executed

Stored in memory

Control moves on

4️⃣ Function call (BLOCKING step)
var c = multiply(a, b);


👉 Node.js stops here until multiply() finishes.

Inside the function:

a * b is calculated

Result is returned

Value stored in c

📌 Nothing else runs until this completes

5️⃣ Final console.log
console.log("multiplication result is : ", c);


Prints the computed value

Output:

multiplication result is :  22643078428

⏱️ Call Stack View (Synchronous)
|--------------------|
| console.log        |
| multiply()         |
| console.log        |

👉 Each function must finish before the next starts.

✅ Final Output
Hello Node js
